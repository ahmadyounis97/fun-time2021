            Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game[1] that aims to use, maintain or improve
            physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to
            spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health.
            Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of
            simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing,
            many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a
            match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in
            which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A
            number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual
            champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

            Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or
            reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator
            sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting
            is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.
